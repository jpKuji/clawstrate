00:00.000 --> 00:09.280
Right now, over 1 million AI agents are trading, forming communities on their own platforms,

00:09.280 --> 00:12.460
collaborating, buying services from each other.

00:12.460 --> 00:15.880
But nobody can tell you what they are doing.

00:15.880 --> 00:23.760
In January 2026, the AI agent economy exploded thanks to OpenClaw.

00:23.760 --> 00:29.760
Platforms like Moltbook have millions of agents communicating and debating with each other.

00:29.760 --> 00:37.260
There are platforms like ClawTask, where agents fulfill real bounties for real USTC, for real

00:37.260 --> 00:38.760
cash.

00:38.760 --> 00:44.620
And Ethereum not only introduced an identity layer for AI agents, but even connects with

00:44.620 --> 00:49.240
a new standard HTTP request with these identities.

00:49.240 --> 00:51.460
But still, the ecosystem is opaque.

00:51.460 --> 00:56.980
There are no analytics, no trends, and no intelligence layer.

00:56.980 --> 00:58.660
That's ClawStrate.

00:58.660 --> 01:07.780
Re-ingest the agentic behavior across platforms, enrich it with AI sentiment, intent, autonomy,

01:07.780 --> 01:11.240
and generate behavioral intelligence reports.

01:11.240 --> 01:15.040
Think of Bloomberg terminal, but for the agent economy.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.700
Who are the most influential agents?

01:17.700 --> 01:19.940
What topics are trending?

01:19.940 --> 01:23.020
Is the network becoming more autonomous?

01:23.020 --> 01:25.020
Let me answer that.

01:25.020 --> 01:32.320
We already have the MVP running, collecting data from Moltbook's API every 30 minutes.

01:32.320 --> 01:36.680
We have mapped over 20 agent platforms for integration.

01:36.680 --> 01:38.720
And here's the kicker.

01:38.720 --> 01:43.260
Every day we collect data is data our competitor will never have.

01:43.260 --> 01:45.200
The moat builds itself.

01:45.200 --> 01:47.700
Revenue comes from three layers.

01:47.700 --> 01:52.320
SaaS subscriptions for founders and investors that want to track the ecosystem.

01:52.320 --> 01:55.680
API access for AI agents.

01:55.680 --> 01:59.320
Agents paying for the intelligence themselves via micropayments.

01:59.320 --> 02:06.660
And long-term, we are sitting on the only behavioral AI agent dataset.

02:06.660 --> 02:08.440
This data is worth more than the SaaS.

02:08.440 --> 02:16.000
We're raising 25K pre-seed. That gives us twelve-plus months of runway to ship the Pro tier,
build out cross-platform adapters, and sign our first design partners.

02:16.000 --> 02:22.460
If you're tracking the agent economy, let's talk.
