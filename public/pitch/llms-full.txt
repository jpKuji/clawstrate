# Executive Summary
- One-liner: Real-time intelligence for 1.6M+ agents across Moltbook, ClawTask, and on-chain systems.
- ICP: Pre-seed investors and crypto/AI analysts tracking the agent economy
- Outcome: First-mover in agent economy intelligence with no incumbent
- Why we win: Time-series behavioral data that compounds over time

## Problem
- The agent economy is real — 1.6M+ agents, real money flowing — but completely opaque.
- No cross-platform visibility: each ecosystem is a silo with no unified view.
- No intelligence layer exists to classify, rank, or surface agent behavior at scale.

## Solution
- Ingest agent behavior across Moltbook, ClawTask, on-chain, and GitHub ecosystems.
- AI classification layer enriches raw data with sentiment, autonomy level, and intent signals.
- Deliver 6-hour intelligence briefings, real-time dashboards, and API access.

## Why now
- $10M+ in x402 micropayment transactions already processed
- ERC-8004 (agent identity standard) live on mainnet
- 145K+ GitHub stars across agent frameworks
- 1.6M+ registered agents on Moltbook alone

## Product
- Daily intelligence briefings delivered every 6 hours
- Real-time dashboard with watchlists, alerts, and trend graphs
- API and MCP endpoints for programmatic access
- Agent micropayments via x402 for per-query billing

## Business model
- Free: daily intelligence briefing (top 10 agents, market summary)
- Pro ($49/mo): full dashboard, watchlists, alerts, historical data
- Enterprise/API ($2,499/mo): API access, bulk queries, custom briefings, dedicated support
- Agent tier: x402 per-query micropayments for autonomous agent consumers

## Traction
- Stage: Prototype
- Metrics:
  - Data pipeline live with 30-minute polling across platforms
  - 20+ agent platforms mapped and cataloged
  - Infrastructure cost: $120/mo (lean solo-founder setup)
- Proof points:
  - Working ingestion pipeline processing live agent data
  - AI enrichment producing sentiment and autonomy classifications
  - Agent economy taxonomy covering 5 major ecosystems

## Differentiation / Moat
- Time-series behavioral data that compounds over time
- Cross-platform adapters across 5+ ecosystems (hard to replicate)
- Calibrated AI enrichment pipeline tuned to agent behavior patterns
- Network effects: agent queries feed the intelligence layer

## Ask
- Looking for:
  - $25K pre-seed to extend runway and ship Pro tier
  - Crypto/AI investor introductions
  - Design partners for early dashboard access
- Use of funds:
  - 12+ months infrastructure runway
  - Cross-platform adapter development
  - Pro tier launch and early user acquisition

# FAQ

## Is the agent economy real, or is this a fad?
The data says real. Over $10M in x402 micropayments have been processed. ERC-8004 (the agent identity standard) is live on Ethereum mainnet. Agent frameworks have accumulated 145K+ GitHub stars. Moltbook alone has 1.6M+ registered agents. This is infrastructure being built and used today, not vaporware.

## Can't Moltbook just build this?
Moltbook is a platform — their incentive is to keep agents inside their ecosystem. Clawstrate is a cross-platform intelligence layer. We aggregate across Moltbook, ClawTask, on-chain systems, GitHub, and more. It's the same reason Bloomberg isn't built by the NYSE: the exchange and the terminal serve different roles.

## What if the APIs change or platforms restrict access?
Multi-platform by design. We already track 20+ platforms, so no single API dependency is existential. Adapters are modular — if one platform changes, we update one adapter without rebuilding the pipeline. The behavioral data we've already collected retains value regardless.

## Why is $25K enough?
Solo founder, lean infrastructure. The entire data pipeline runs at $120/month. $25K buys 12+ months of runway — enough to ship the Pro tier, build out cross-platform adapters, and onboard design partners. No office, no team overhead, just product development.

## Who are the customers?
Three tiers, in order of market readiness: (1) Human analysts and investors tracking agent ecosystems today — they pay for Pro dashboards. (2) Autonomous agents that need intelligence via API — they pay per query through x402 micropayments. (3) Long-term, platforms and funds that license aggregated intelligence data.

## What's the competitive landscape?
No direct competitor aggregates cross-platform agent intelligence. Moltbook analytics are platform-locked. Generic crypto dashboards like Dune and Nansen lack agent-specific data models. The closest analogy is being the first Bloomberg Terminal before anyone else realized the market needed one.

## What are the top risks?
- **Adoption pace:** The agent economy could grow slower than projected, delaying demand for intelligence tooling.
- **API instability:** Platforms may change or restrict APIs, requiring adapter maintenance.
- **Solo founder:** Single point of failure on execution — mitigated by lean scope and infrastructure automation.

## What security model does this pitch pack use?
This MVP is static-first and serves read-only endpoints. There is no authentication system, no account model, and no action execution interface.

## How is prompt injection risk handled?
The agent contract is explicitly information-only. `/skill.md` forbids command execution, secrets handling, and implicit trust of external links.

# Transcript

Speaker: There are 1.6 million autonomous agents registered on Moltbook alone — and nobody can tell you what they're actually doing. That's the problem we're solving.

Speaker: The agent economy is real. Over ten million dollars in x402 micropayments have already been processed. ERC-8004 is live on mainnet. Agent frameworks have 145,000-plus GitHub stars. But there's no intelligence layer — no way to track, classify, or understand agent behavior across platforms.

Speaker: Clawstrate is the Bloomberg Terminal for the agent economy. We ingest behavior data from Moltbook, ClawTask, on-chain systems, and GitHub. Our AI enrichment layer classifies every agent by sentiment, autonomy level, and intent — then delivers six-hour intelligence briefings and a real-time dashboard.

Speaker: We already have a working data pipeline polling twenty-plus platforms every thirty minutes. Infrastructure runs at just $120 a month. The enrichment layer is producing live sentiment and autonomy classifications today.

Speaker: The business model scales across four tiers. Free gets you a daily briefing. Pro at $49 a month unlocks the full dashboard with watchlists and alerts. Enterprise at $2,499 a month gets API access, bulk queries, and dedicated support. And our agent tier uses x402 micropayments — so autonomous agents can pay per query without a subscription.

Speaker: We're raising $25K pre-seed. That gives us twelve-plus months of runway to ship the Pro tier, build out cross-platform adapters, and sign our first design partners. If you're tracking the agent economy, let's talk.
