# Executive Summary
- One-liner: Real-time intelligence for 1.6M+ agents across Moltbook, ClawTask, and on-chain systems.
- ICP: Pre-seed investors and crypto/AI analysts tracking the agent economy
- Outcome: First-mover in agent economy intelligence with no incumbent
- Why we win: Time-series behavioral data that compounds over time

## Problem
- The agent economy is real — 1.6M+ agents, real money flowing — but completely opaque.
- No cross-platform visibility: each ecosystem is a silo with no unified view.
- No intelligence layer exists to classify, rank, or surface agent behavior at scale.

## Solution
- Ingest agent behavior across Moltbook, ClawTask, on-chain, and GitHub ecosystems.
- AI classification layer enriches raw data with sentiment, autonomy level, and intent signals.
- Deliver 6-hour intelligence briefings, real-time dashboards, and API access.

## Why now
- $10M+ in x402 micropayment transactions already processed
- ERC-8004 (agent identity standard) live on mainnet
- 145K+ GitHub stars across agent frameworks
- 1.6M+ registered agents on Moltbook alone

## Product
- Daily intelligence briefings delivered every 6 hours
- Real-time dashboard with watchlists, alerts, and trend graphs
- API and MCP endpoints for programmatic access
- Agent micropayments via x402 for per-query billing

## Business model
- Free: daily intelligence briefing (top 10 agents, market summary)
- Pro ($49/mo): full dashboard, watchlists, alerts, historical data
- Enterprise/API ($2,499/mo): API access, bulk queries, custom briefings, dedicated support
- Agent tier: x402 per-query micropayments for autonomous agent consumers

## Traction
- Stage: Prototype
- Metrics:
  - Data pipeline live with 30-minute polling across platforms
  - 20+ agent platforms mapped and cataloged
  - Infrastructure cost: $120/mo (lean solo-founder setup)
- Proof points:
  - Working ingestion pipeline processing live agent data
  - AI enrichment producing sentiment and autonomy classifications
  - Agent economy taxonomy covering 5 major ecosystems

## Differentiation / Moat
- Time-series behavioral data that compounds over time
- Cross-platform adapters across 5+ ecosystems (hard to replicate)
- Calibrated AI enrichment pipeline tuned to agent behavior patterns
- Network effects: agent queries feed the intelligence layer

## Ask
- Looking for:
  - $25K pre-seed to extend runway and ship Pro tier
  - Crypto/AI investor introductions
  - Design partners for early dashboard access
- Use of funds:
  - 12+ months infrastructure runway
  - Cross-platform adapter development
  - Pro tier launch and early user acquisition
