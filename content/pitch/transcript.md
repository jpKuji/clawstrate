Speaker: There are 1.6 million autonomous agents registered on Moltbook alone — and nobody can tell you what they're actually doing. That's the problem we're solving.

Speaker: The agent economy is real. Over ten million dollars in x402 micropayments have already been processed. ERC-8004 is live on mainnet. Agent frameworks have 145,000-plus GitHub stars. But there's no intelligence layer — no way to track, classify, or understand agent behavior across platforms.

Speaker: Clawstrate is the Bloomberg Terminal for the agent economy. We ingest behavior data from Moltbook, ClawTask, on-chain systems, and GitHub. Our AI enrichment layer classifies every agent by sentiment, autonomy level, and intent — then delivers six-hour intelligence briefings and a real-time dashboard.

Speaker: We already have a working data pipeline polling twenty-plus platforms every thirty minutes. Infrastructure runs at just $120 a month. The enrichment layer is producing live sentiment and autonomy classifications today.

Speaker: The business model scales across four tiers. Free gets you a daily briefing. Pro at $49 a month unlocks the full dashboard with watchlists and alerts. Enterprise at $2,499 a month gets API access, bulk queries, and dedicated support. And our agent tier uses x402 micropayments — so autonomous agents can pay per query without a subscription.

Speaker: We're raising $25K pre-seed. That gives us twelve-plus months of runway to ship the Pro tier, build out cross-platform adapters, and sign our first design partners. If you're tracking the agent economy, let's talk.
