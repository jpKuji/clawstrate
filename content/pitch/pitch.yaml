project_slug: "clawstrate"
version: "0.1"
last_updated: "2026-02-11"
title: "Clawstrate"
tagline: "The Bloomberg Terminal for the Agent Economy"
one_liner: "Real-time intelligence for 1.6M+ agents across Moltbook, ClawTask, and on-chain systems."
icp: "Pre-seed investors and crypto/AI analysts tracking the agent economy"
outcome: "First-mover in agent economy intelligence with no incumbent"
hero_bullets:
  - "Cross-platform agent tracking across 5+ ecosystems"
  - "AI-enriched behavioral intelligence (sentiment, autonomy, intent)"
  - "Agent-native API with x402 micropayments"
problem:
  - "The agent economy is real — 1.6M+ agents, real money flowing — but completely opaque."
  - "No cross-platform visibility: each ecosystem is a silo with no unified view."
  - "No intelligence layer exists to classify, rank, or surface agent behavior at scale."
solution:
  - "Ingest agent behavior across Moltbook, ClawTask, on-chain, and GitHub ecosystems."
  - "AI classification layer enriches raw data with sentiment, autonomy level, and intent signals."
  - "Deliver 6-hour intelligence briefings, real-time dashboards, and API access."
why_now:
  - "$10M+ in x402 micropayment transactions already processed"
  - "ERC-8004 (agent identity standard) live on mainnet"
  - "145K+ GitHub stars across agent frameworks"
  - "1.6M+ registered agents on Moltbook alone"
product:
  - "Daily intelligence briefings delivered every 6 hours"
  - "Real-time dashboard with watchlists, alerts, and trend graphs"
  - "API and MCP endpoints for programmatic access"
  - "Agent micropayments via x402 for per-query billing"
business_model:
  - "Free: daily intelligence briefing (top 10 agents, market summary)"
  - "Pro ($49/mo): full dashboard, watchlists, alerts, historical data"
  - "Enterprise/API ($2,499/mo): API access, bulk queries, custom briefings, dedicated support"
  - "Agent tier: x402 per-query micropayments for autonomous agent consumers"
competition:
  - "No direct competitor aggregates cross-platform agent intelligence."
  - "Moltbook is a platform, not an analytics layer — different incentive structure."
  - "Generic crypto dashboards (Dune, Nansen) lack agent-specific data models."
moat:
  - "Time-series behavioral data that compounds over time"
  - "Cross-platform adapters across 5+ ecosystems (hard to replicate)"
  - "Calibrated AI enrichment pipeline tuned to agent behavior patterns"
  - "Network effects: agent queries feed the intelligence layer"
traction:
  stage: "Prototype"
  metrics:
    - "Data pipeline live with 30-minute polling across platforms"
    - "20+ agent platforms mapped and cataloged"
    - "Infrastructure cost: $120/mo (lean solo-founder setup)"
  proof_points:
    - "Working ingestion pipeline processing live agent data"
    - "AI enrichment producing sentiment and autonomy classifications"
    - "Agent economy taxonomy covering 5 major ecosystems"

  looking_for:
    - "$25K pre-seed to extend runway and ship Pro tier"
    - "Crypto/AI investor introductions"
    - "Design partners for early dashboard access"
  use_of_funds:
    - "12+ months infrastructure runway"
    - "Cross-platform adapter development"
    - "Pro tier launch and early user acquisition"
